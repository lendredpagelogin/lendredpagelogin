Your interest rate is also a big factor in deciding which student loan ought to be repaid as soon as possible. However, there are different ways to approach this aspect. One strategy is to prioritize the loan with the highest interest rate first, as that can mean paying less in interest in the long run. However, if your federal student loans happen to have higher rates than your private ones, you'll have to weigh whether the interest savings are worth giving up the formerâ€™s benefits flexibility sooner.

Another factor to consider is whether the interest rate is fixed or variable. As previously mentioned, federal student loans are fixed, while private loans can be either. If you have both types, you might prefer tackling the variable loan first to limit the window in which rates can increase.
